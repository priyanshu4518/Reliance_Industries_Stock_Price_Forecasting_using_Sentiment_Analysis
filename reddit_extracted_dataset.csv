So I think we fully recognize that it’s going to be necessary to follow through,” one of the senior administration officials said. \n\nModi’s visit comes at a time when the U.S. is adopting a strategy of “friend-shoring” as it diversifies away from China and taps into the potential of other countries in the region.\n\n“This is India’s time to drive incredible growth, and we are very much looking forward to working with the prime minister and everyone in India to achieve tremendous success together,” Applied Materials\n CEO Gary Dickerson said Wednesday in a video interview published on Modi’s official YouTube page. \n\n“Many companies around the world see the trust and tremendous talent that is in India.

This isn't so much friend-shoring as a moment of coinciding interests.

I would say you should understand news related issues that correlates to copper. day trading rules for HG that works for me is 2 minute time frame for exection.  5 and 15 minutes time frame intraday for direction and trend following. If there is a day where one of my listed financial instruments are trend following then i will make a killing. As of now NQ has been my go and averaging 1000 points per month with a daily target of 150. Use things like 9 ema for trend and 50SMA for direction. MACD for bull and bear strength. Use things like Break of structure and ChoCH as it respects sentiment. It respects High of day and Low of day aswell. Make sure to understand where commodity news happens such as OPEC+ as i do recall at 4am PST i was down .150 from not checking news. Economic calendar can prevent it.', 'Many thanks for that. Super helpful. Do you ever hold positions over 1 month ?', 'In my personal opinion, Maintenance is stressful and the margin is vastly more than day trading this commodity. Rough average across brokers for maintenance is 4500. and thats 1 contract. you cannot scale out Copper/HG with that. Micro Copper would be a better idea instead of Commodity exchange(COMEX) standard contract (10x micro value per tick) Copper is beautiful to trade for trend traders which is the bread and butter of successful traders. But lets be honest, what if we get hit with a black swan or a geopolitical event or a supply and demand crash/gain whilst be on the opposite side while swinging copper? that is my curiosity and swinging is a big no no for me. especially on futures. But if we were to use my technical analysis on copper, the forward curve is bullish. We are likely to break high as its respectful of the longer term time frame. 200sma is where institutions push the price and its moving to the upside for years. we will hit 5 on the futures copper in the next few years as currently we are at 4. $1 gain on copper is $25000 on 1 standard contract.  Fundamental analysis is copper is a sought out commodity for every or most . It is used to build machines,watches,clockes,buildings,construction, consumer products, vehicles aswell. Copper has been soaring since Electrical vehicles are the new guy on the block. copper is a key component in electrical vehicles.

Think of Coca Cola, it has survived every pandemic, world war, inflation, market crash and it has been going up since 1930s. Copper is similar to that. Its longevity is substantial. If you want to take a maintenace position (swing on copper) I would place it here at 3.91 and place rought Stops at 3.8. this is under Key Demand zone on the 1 day time frame and 4.5 and 5 would be supply where sellers might short term try pushing price down. But as of now its a green light buy. BUT AT YOUR OWN RISK THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. past performance is not indictive of future results. and only risk what you can afford. Compound growth is real. Be okay with taking 10 losses even 20 in a row. Good luck with your trading and find out what works! i would also front and back test paper on copper and figure out the way it moves usually. I manage a 265000 account on crude oil futures and i risk only 0.4-0.5% each trade. average $10 barrel gains per month which is like 25,000USD per month.

2024-03-16,"['Baseload Power Doesn’t Make Sense Anymore', 'U.S. oil companies use AI for faster shale drilling, mitigating OPEC production cuts']","[['There are a lot of people who didn\'t read the article showing up in the comments to make irrelevant points about 100% renewable grids, which aren\'t mentioned in the article whatsoever.\n\nThe article\'s point is that traditionally baseload generation was the cheapest sources of energy, but the cheapest sources of energy are now renewables, which don\'t operate 100% of the time like baseload sources.\n\nIn such scenarios when renewables are at peak generation times it would be more optimal to curtail the more expensive baseload generation, i.e. have them operate in a load following capacity and shut down during peak renewable generation times, but these generation methods are often not designed to be shut down frequently, so the market is left with more expensive (and often more polluting) electricity, and the cheaper renewable sources are curtailed instead, simply because the ""baseload"" generation isn\'t designed to be curtailed.', 'Renewables are intermittent. But people underestimate that both the weather, and demand, are forecast very accurately. A heavily integrated smart grid with different energy sources, and a number of loads that the utilities can shed (think demand response programs) Is the grid of the future.', ""Intermittent renewables are the new baseload.  The power economy has both changed in a fundamental way (running huge plants flat out all the time no longer makes economic sense) and not changed at all (followers and peakers are needed to fill the difference between supply of cheapest power and momentary demand).\n\nEveryone arguing for nuclear needs to read this article to at least begin to understand why nuclear as we know it doesn't make sense in an economy where intermittent renewables are the cheapest source of power."", ""Baseload won't ever go away, but I think distributed resources (DERs) are going to change how people think about it. Right now, we use the monolithic power plant idea, for example, 500MW, and think it has to be replaced with renewable of the same size. Trying to get PV plus BESS of that size and reliability is both difficult and economically challenging. Technology will certainly improve that, but I think there's a more fundamental point to examine: the only reason fossil fuel plants were built that large was because it wasn't really feasible to do otherwise. The same is not true for solar or batteries, and if we scale them down, the equation for baseload looks very different. \n\nLet's look at a simple example. According to the US Energy Information Administration, the average daily electric usage is around 27kWh. We'll round that up to 30kWh to make our math easier. Add in a 20kW rooftop solar system (again, an easy number but also not unreasonable to fit on a roof) and a 70kWh battery (more on that size later). The PV systems kW is close to the daily kWh, so it should serve the daily load easily. But what about clouds? Or during the night? That's where the battery comes in. Ideally, the solar does the heavy lifting, but worst-case the battery can serve our average load for a little over 2 days. That gives us two days to get something out of our PV system. That may not sound like a long time (we all remember long winters without sun), but you have to remember that we don't need that much power. Over two days, we'll use 60kWh, but our PV system is 20kW. It only needs 3 hours of light to meet that. With an intelligent system, we could lower our average load, too, for a bad string of days. After all, in an 'emergency' like this, we need the fridge, some lights, a few other things. Realistically, you could probably stretch 100kWh out to 7 days. That's 5 hours of daylight needed, over an entire week. 5 hours out of 168. Less than 3%. It doesn't need to be blazing sun either, PV may not work great in overcast weather, but they still work.\n\nIt's a very simple example, and there are lots of variables to factor in, but it should show that we are dealing with a much smaller system, so its far easier to get the power we need. Today, this system would cost in excess of $100,000, which is a lot. Using the average cost of electricity of around $2,000/year, the payoff period is 50 years. Too long for the equipment life, but what if costs come down 20%? 30%? 50%? It gets a lot closer. We can also double-dip with our battery: 70kWh is around the typical size of an EV, so we can factor in gas savings now, too. Our systems getting a lot closer to being viable. \n\nObviously it's not this easy, but my main point is baseload changes a lot when you factor in how scalable renewable are. We don't need to install one 500MW installation to serve baseload when we can do the same by installing 25,000 20kW systems instead."", 'Baseload is just a talking point for the fossil fuel/nuclear bots.\n\nA highly decentralised network of renewables, storage and grid forming inverters is all the electricity network we need. No place for monolithic centralised generation in this new world.'], ['some wild sh*t', 'Nice to see the industry can fight back, unlike in 2015.

They don't make sale decisons bases in tax cycles\n\n\n2) Those who do buy for purely investment reasons, are not always able to time the market.

If someone bought SGBs even three years back they would have made >7% extra returns  returns anyway over physical gold (not accounting for storage costs , making charges etc) .

What are your thoughts on him?', 'Flare monitoring: does it make sense?']","[['Your coffee cups will get smaller and smaller', 'This move absolutely is about prioritizing profit over ""Starbucks"" culture. The entire reason for this CEO change is because Starbucks is facing an activist investor challenge from Elliott Management and Starboard Value. They want more revenue generation and profits and also wanted to get onto the Starbucks board. \n\nNiccol is exactly the guy the activists could have wanted as CEO. Drove huge sales increases at Chipotle and the stock delivered huge returns under his tenure from 2018-2024. Took learnings from his previous job at Taco Bell and drove sharp focus on cost cutting and controls on labor/food (I think his dream would have been a fully automated assembly line). He expanded store count substantially, created limited time items for first time, spent heavily on ads, pushed digital sales and longer store hours---all things that promoted profit. \n\nOn the flip side, these all came at a substantial hit to their reputation with customers. Alongside steady and sharp price increases, they now have the reputation for giving skimpy portions. They were known previously for being a great value, but no more. The product is also very inconsistent across locations, across ordering in-person vs digitally  and all of that leads to customers being wary of going there. This is Chipotle\'s reputation with customers now. \n\nNot to mention that Chipotle has a lot of disgruntled employees--their store labor controls are strict and cause restaurants to be run on skeleton crews. Niccol is strongly anti-union and has kept unions out of Chipotle. There\'s not a lot of training either.  Then when they face heavy amounts of digital orders, unhappy customers and customers who cajole them for bigger portions, you get the recipe for the high labor turnover problem they have. Which also causes the bad customer service experience that many people face in a Chipotle store.', 'Love him!  He allowed me to bail out of a dead position and redeploy the capital elsewhere.', 'A good CEO is great, and can sometimes turn around a poorly performing company.\n\nLook at Unicredit which until recently was worst performing bank in Italy. \n\nAfter the new CEO came in and turned things around, it is now one of the best performing banks in Europe.', 'Idk if Starbucks is showing much growth outside of international expansion.

The opportunity lies in an estimated $8 trillion to $10 trillion in new US assets, a potential 15% increase in the total market up for grabs in North America, according to the analysis.\n\nAsset managers worldwide collectively managed a record $132 trillion in June, an 8% jump from 2023 and a 21% increase from the prior year, according to the report.

The industry is now “equal parts a place of intense competition with challenged product segments and a market that’s ripe with promise and plenty, particularly in seizing opportunities beyond the balance sheet.”\n\nMoney managers stand to gain $5 trillion to $6 trillion of private credit and debt business from big banks pulling back lending over the next decade.

Let us take the base case of a person who is quite happy with Nifty 50 and wants to simply follow the index. And for simplicity, let us ignore the tax impact on portfolio changes.\n\n1.  Assuming enough capital, the person can buy the stocks in the exact weightage of the index. She would have to pay for the demat account, brokerage and related transaction costs. \n2. There is also the cost of keeping up with the index every day and making necessary adjustments, investing the dividends back, etc. So the transactions are not one time, but ongoing. All these have costs.\n3. The TRI index does not consider any of these costs - so this investor would fall short of the index by 0.1 - 0.5 percent.  In a Nifty index fund, the investor hands over this work to the fund, and the costs would become the TER.   (Now you can look at the TER of the Nifty index funds.)\n4. Now let us say that the investor wants to beat the index. She would then have to spend time looking at undervalued stocks, underperforming sectors, potential high growth stocks, etc. etc.  They would need skill and also time. \n5. In an active fund, you hand over this work also the fund. There is research team, management team, etc. and the expenses are higher.  (Some CIO salaries are in many crores of rupees.)  So the TER of the active funds are higher - close to 1% of direct equity funds. \n6. Now there are also compliance and regulatory costs for the fund house - they too go into the TER.  Regardless, you have to be clear if you are looking at index returns or an alpha over index, and accordingly choose 3 or 5 and accept the TER.\n\nThere is no point in picking an index fund just because the TER is lower. If you don't believe in indexing, please stay with active funds. \n\nAnd for all the active fund fans, I am yet to see a proper analysis that goes back in time and shows performance. If you are in 2024 and analysing past 5 years or 10 years performance, you are missing the fund category changes, fund closures and mergers, etc. There is a lot of survivorship bias.  Just to give an example Nippon multicap, HDFC Flexicap underperformed the index for many years.  If you look at 2021 or so, their performance would have precluded from being considered in the top rankers. The recent outperformance masks this period and makes them look good."", ""You are paying to someone to generate better returns when compared to an FD for example.

This is a huge deal guys! We invest in firms to ensure capital appreciation occurs. After reading this post, I re analysed the DRHP, OP is correct for the most part and while I disagree with some things, this isn’t the best IPO for listing gains though it’s an average stock for long term investment in the auto sector.\n\nIt seems Hyundai is exploiting transfer pricing policies to move wealth out of India (royalties,dividends, component import pricing etc), they didn’t have a mote to begin with which I had mentioned earlier in a separate post which I since took down. Something not mentioned is a declining market share, which is very worrisome due to them having stiff competition.\n\nI don’t agree with the P/E analysis of OP completely, it is over valued af but it will be bigger than Tata Motors. This  us due to them having a lot of other factors at play regarding the value they provide compared to Tata Motors (foreign brand, better customer segment, premium-ization strategy would drive price up regardless of the value delivered or not in real terms).

That’s not a coincidence—it’s by design. IT cells of political parties have become powerful tools to manage and manipulate public opinion. By controlling the narrative, they dictate what we talk about, what we’re outraged by, and ultimately, what we ignore.\n\nThese IT cells are not just about running campaigns; they’re about shaping reality itself. Here’s how they operate:\n\n1. Flooding Social Media with Propaganda\nBy saturating platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram with curated content, hashtags, and “trending” topics, they ensure that only their version of the story dominates. Whether it’s fake news, half-truths, or exaggerated claims, they carefully craft what people see and believe.\n\n\n2. Distracting from Core Issues\nWhile unemployment rises, inflation eats away at savings, and public services deteriorate, IT cells amplify divisive and emotional issues like religion, caste, or national pride. By keeping citizens engrossed in these debates, they distract from real questions: Why isn’t the government delivering on its promises? Where are the reforms?\n\n\n3. Creating Echo Chambers\nAlgorithms amplify their narratives, showing you more of what aligns with your existing views. This reinforces biases, polarizes society, and makes meaningful discussions almost impossible.\n\n\n4. Targeting Dissenters\nVoices that question the government’s actions are often silenced or discredited. IT cells engage in online harassment, trolling, and spreading misinformation about dissenters to delegitimize them.\n\n\n5. Building a Cult of Personality\nIT cells focus heavily on glorifying leaders, often portraying them as infallible or god-like. This hero worship diverts attention from policy failures, as criticism of leadership is seen as an attack on the nation itself.\n\n\n\nThe result? A public too distracted and divided to demand accountability. Instead of asking why there’s no action on pollution, healthcare, or education, we’re debating issues that conveniently shift attention away from those in power.\n\nThis is not governance—it’s psychological warfare. Until we recognize these tactics and refuse to be pawns in their game, we’ll remain trapped in this cycle of manipulation. Let’s start asking the uncomfortable questions and focusing on the issues that truly matter.']]"

Zepto and any other quickcommerce platform for that matter uses the VC Money to figure out the following \n1) Dark store penetration and expansion. In areas where dark stores aren't profitable ie Minimum order value on a daily basis that's where the VC MONEY handle the loss\n2) the tech costs of app and the staff running the company and optimzing the algorithms. \n3) cost of delivery \n4) Marketing and ads to promote the platform (but most brand films are in collaboration with brands so a part is paid by other brands)\n\nThey DO NOT PAY for the discounts. NOT ONE CENT\n\nThere are some exceptions where they wish to grow the category.  But usually they don't. \n\nI have worked in KAM roles in multiple brands. The model is simple. If I have a product A who's MRP is say 100 rs. \nI pay zepto a fix margin. So 30% (norm. It's higher for blinkit). So they pay me only 70rs. So i they sell it to a consumer for 100rs they keep 30 and give me 70 \n\nSo take case of discounts. They put it for say 80rs. So instead of 100 they get 80 from the buyer. So they balance it 100-80 = 20. They raise a debit note agaisnt it. And the brand has to pay it back.\n\nNot only that. The banners. The placement on top of search for keyword search. Everything is monetized. \n\nSo zeptos net profit is = margin from brands(30%avg) + Banners and marketing placements - cost of dark stores and delivery -tech cost - any marketing (ads and extra coupons)\n\nSo the critical part is increasing the former and decreasing the latter. Blinkit have managed it by keeping margin highs (new brands are asked for as high as 55%) and using the learnings from zomato to optimize the delivery costs.

The study revealed that 55% of the 143 members of the JTC21 technical committee, which is responsible for creating AI standards in the EU, represent corporate interests. Notably, nearly 25% of these members come from well-known US tech companies like Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, and Google. In stark contrast, participation in civil society is limited to just 9%.\n\nThis corporate dominance has attracted considerable criticism, especially as the AI Act, a crucial regulation to address risks associated with AI systems, begins its implementation. The developed standards are intended to ensure compliance with EU safety regulations and could significantly impact various fields, including medical devices and consumer products like toys. Critics, including CEO researcher Bram Vranken, argue that allowing private entities to make key decisions about fairness, trustworthiness, and bias undermines public accountability and fundamental rights.\n\nConcerns have also been expressed about the pace and inclusivity of the standard-setting processes, with national standard bodies in countries like France and the UK similarly dominated by corporate representatives. The European Commission has defended its approach, stating that the proposed standards will undergo rigorous evaluation and be open to objections from member states and the European Parliament.\n\nHowever, regulators warn that the slow pace of standardisation could hinder effective implementation. As industry-led bodies take control of these processes, questions arise about their ability to safeguard societal interests in the face of corporate priorities.', 'Europe has no “Big Tech” companies, no?', 'use to be nokia before Microsoft trojan horsed them 😂']]"

Around the same time, Reddit\'s CEO called out all AI companies whose crawlers he said were ""a pain in the ass to block,"" despite the tech industry otherwise agreeing to respect ""no scraping"" robots.txt rules.\n\n>Watching the controversy unfold was a software developer whom Ars has granted anonymity to discuss his development of malware (we\'ll call him Aaron). Shortly after he noticed Facebook\'s crawler exceeding 30 million hits on his site, Aaron began plotting a new kind of attack on crawlers ""clobbering"" websites that he told Ars he hoped would give ""teeth"" to robots.txt.\n\n>Building on an anti-spam cybersecurity tactic known as tarpitting, he created Nepenthes, malicious software named after a carnivorous plant that will ""eat just about anything that finds its way inside.""\n\n>Aaron clearly warns users that Nepenthes is aggressive malware. It\'s not to be deployed by site owners uncomfortable with trapping AI crawlers and sending them down an ""infinite maze"" of static files with no exit links, where they ""get stuck"" and ""thrash around"" for months, he tells users. Once trapped, the crawlers can be fed gibberish data, aka Markov babble, which is designed to poison AI models. That\'s likely an appealing bonus feature for any site owners who, like Aaron, are fed up with paying for AI scraping and just want to watch AI burn.\n\n>Tarpits were originally designed to waste spammers\' time and resources, but creators like Aaron have now evolved the tactic into an anti-AI weapon. As of this writing, Aaron confirmed that Nepenthes can effectively trap all the major web crawlers. So far, only OpenAI\'s crawler has managed to escape.\n\n>It\'s unclear how much damage tarpits or other AI attacks can ultimately do. Last May, Laxmi Korada, Microsoft\'s director of partner technology, published a report detailing how leading AI companies were coping with poisoning, one of the earliest AI defense tactics deployed. He noted that all companies have developed poisoning countermeasures, while OpenAI ""has been quite vigilant"" and excels at detecting the ""first signs of data poisoning attempts.""\n\n>Despite these efforts, he concluded that data poisoning was ""a serious threat to machine learning models."" And in 2025, tarpitting represents a new threat, potentially increasing the costs of fresh data at a moment when AI companies are heavily investing and competing to innovate quickly while rarely turning significant profits.\n\n>""A link to a Nepenthes location from your site will flood out valid URLs within your site\'s domain name, making it unlikely the crawler will access real content,"" a Nepenthes explainer reads.\n\n>The only AI company that responded to Ars\' request to comment was OpenAI, whose spokesperson confirmed that OpenAI is already working on a way to fight tarpitting.\n\n>""We’re aware of efforts to disrupt AI web crawlers,"" OpenAI\'s spokesperson said. ""We design our systems to be resilient while respecting robots.txt and standard web practices.""\n\n>But to Aaron, the fight is not about winning. Instead, it\'s about resisting the AI industry further decaying the Internet with tech that no one asked for, like chatbots that replace customer service agents or the rise of inaccurate AI search summaries. By releasing Nepenthes, he hopes to do as much damage as possible, perhaps spiking companies\' AI training costs, dragging out training efforts, or even accelerating model collapse, with tarpits helping to delay the next wave of enshittification.\n\n>Nepenthes was released in mid-January but was instantly popularized beyond Aaron\'s expectations after tech journalist Cory Doctorow boosted a tech commentator, Jürgen Geuter, praising the novel AI attack method on Mastodon. Very quickly, Aaron was shocked to see engagement with Nepenthes skyrocket.\n\n>When software developer and hacker Gergely Nagy, who goes by the handle ""algernon"" online, saw Nepenthes, he was delighted. At that time, Nagy told Ars that nearly all of his server\'s bandwidth was being ""eaten"" by AI crawlers.\n\n>Already blocking scraping and attempting to poison AI models through a simpler method, Nagy took his defense method further and created his own tarpit, Iocaine. He told Ars the tarpit immediately killed off about 94 percent of bot traffic to his site, which was primarily from AI crawlers. Soon, social media discussion drove users to inquire about Iocaine deployment, including not just individuals but also organizations wanting to take stronger steps to block scraping.\n\n>Iocaine takes ideas (not code) from Nepenthes, but it\'s more intent on using the tarpit to poison AI models. Nagy used a reverse proxy to trap crawlers in an ""infinite maze of garbage"" in an attempt to slowly poison their data collection as much as possible for daring to ignore robots.txt.\n\n>Running malware like Nepenthes can burden servers, too. Aaron likened the cost of running Nepenthes to running a cheap virtual machine on a Raspberry Pi, and Nagy said that serving crawlers Iocaine costs about the same as serving his website.\n\n>But Aaron told Ars that Nepenthes wasting resources is the chief objection he\'s seen preventing its deployment. Critics fear that deploying Nepenthes widely will not only burden their servers but also increase the costs of powering all that AI crawling for nothing.\n\n>Nagy agrees that the more anti-AI attacks there are, the greater the potential is for them to have an impact. And by releasing Iocaine, Nagy showed that social media chatter about new attacks can inspire new tools within a few days. Marcus Butler, an independent software developer, similarly built his poisoning attack called Quixotic over a few days, he told Ars. Soon afterward, he received messages from others who built their own versions of his tool.\n\n>Tarpit creators like Nagy will likely be watching to see if poisoning attacks continue growing in sophistication.

As an example he expects that limited regulation is necessary when consumers can vote with their wallet or bring legal action to punish companies acting against the public interest.

Wells Fargo can harm consumers and break the law time and time again and be fined cents on the dollar for the money they gained, auto manufacturers can sell deficient cars knowingly, pharmaceutical companies can deform children and addict entire populations and never see consequences, not that consumers could realistically take their business elsewhere even if they knew and wanted to. \n\nMarkets simply are not free or fair or perfectly efficient and consumers cannot be fully informed on producers, production methods, and products of everything all the time. We simply have to recognize more nuance and more externalities than Friedman was even aware of at the time of his popularity.\n\nEdit: worth noting that because the USs economic institutions at the time when he studied were actually more inclusive and more pluralistic, there was legitimately less objective contrast in many of these areas but that still doesn’t make discounting it valid.

Dividends aren’t just free money, it’s value being passed directly to the shareholders instead of being kept within the company. The company now has 3% less money because they gave it to the shareholders.\n\nMore specifically, it has to do with market cap. Market cap is the (amount of outstanding shares X the price per share). So, if there are 1,000 shares and the stock is $100, the market cap is $100,000. So when the 3% dividend is paid, they take 3% of that $100K and distribute it to share holders.

When a dividend is made, some of that value is realized, lowering the future value (usually temporarily).\n\nFor a security with regular dividends, the expected future dividend will be a component of the price. Once that dividend is distributed, that component goes to $0 until future profitability restores it over time before the next dividend.\n\nIn a hypothetical stock market with no speculation, this is easy to imagine. If a company has $1000 in assets and 10 shares, each share is worth $100. If it distributes $1 of assets to each shareholder, it has $990 in assets and each share is worth $99. The net worth of shareholders doesn't change, but 1% of that was realized by the dividend and distributed as liquid income, which can be kept or reinvested.\n\nThis is easiest to see with a security like SGOV, which has an inherent value of $100/share and earns monthly dividends based on treasury interest. Throughout the month the price will rise steadily (with a slope equal to the average interest rate across it's holdings), until the interest is distributed and it goes down. This creates a sawtooth oscillation based on the expiration cycle of short term treasuries.\n\nWith other securities more factors are also at play in driving the price, so this can be harder to see.

None of these are particularly tough.', 'The forecasted dividend yields you’re seeing for 2025, 2026, and 2027 are likely based on a combination of factors, but they are indeed estimates and carry inherent uncertainty. Let me break down how these forecasts can be made and why they can’t be fully precise:\n\n1. Dividends per Share:\nInvestment banks and analysts often base their dividend forecasts on the company’s historical payout ratio (how much profit the company has been paying out in dividends), future earnings projections, and management’s stated intentions about dividends.\n\nIf a company has been paying a relatively stable dividend and has a predictable earnings growth trajectory, analysts can reasonably estimate the future dividends by assuming that the company will maintain or slightly adjust its payout policy.\n\nFor example, if a company has historically paid out 40% of its earnings as dividends, and analysts expect its earnings to grow by 5% annually, they might forecast that dividends will grow by a similar percentage, barring any significant changes in strategy.\n\n2. Stock Price:\nThe price per share in the dividend yield formula can be trickier to predict, as it depends on various market factors such as:\n\nMarket sentiment\nEconomic conditions\nIndustry performance\nCompany-specific news or events (e.g., mergers, acquisitions, leadership changes)\nAnalysts can use valuation models (like discounted cash flow models or price-to-earnings ratios) to estimate a potential price range for the stock. However, these models rely on assumptions, which makes long-term stock price predictions inherently uncertain.\n\n3. Dividend Yield Formula:\nDividend Yield = Annual Dividends per Share / Price per Share\nA forecast of 10%, 16%, 16% dividend yield could mean that either analysts are expecting the company to significantly raise its dividend payouts or the stock price to remain relatively stable or even fall over the next few years.\n\n4. Accuracy of Forecasts:\nWhile the forecasted dividend yields can give you an idea of potential returns, they are by no means guaranteed. The forecasting models and assumptions could change depending on how the company performs and broader market conditions evolve. Analysts will regularly update their forecasts to reflect changes in the company’s financial health, earnings potential, and stock price movements.\n\nSo, when you see these forecasts, it’s important to recognize that they are based on the best available information at the time and represent educated guesses rather than precise predictions. Companies can alter their dividend policies (e.g., cutting, maintaining, or increasing dividends), and stock prices are often volatile, making long-term predictions challenging.\n\nWhile analysts use data and financial models to predict future dividends and stock prices, these forecasts can only be as accurate as the assumptions behind them, and there’s always a degree of uncertainty. The forecasted high dividend yield (e.g., 16%) could be based on assumptions about stable or declining stock prices, or expectations for growing dividends.', '> even a remote degree of accuracy\n\nof course they will say ""we have our proven methods, but we cannot disclose"" but practically this method is ""my gut feeling says maybe""', 'What is the name of the stock?

How can they bid up stock prices and inflate the market further if their excess cash is already in the stock market? \n\nYou are correct that for every purchase, there is a sale, but what matters is whether the price is higher or lower than the previous price.

The spokesperson for the Whitehouse announced that they have found 36,000 dollars in DEI ""fraud"" that will undoubtedly go a long way in paying for this. \n\nWell on your way Elon. Your work is almost done', 'WASHINGTON—House Republicans released on Wednesday the first blueprint for their “one big, beautiful bill” that would cut taxes, reduce spending and provide money for border enforcement.\n\nLawmakers created that outline after weeks of tense internal meetings among their competing factions, and it isn’t clear yet whether they satisfied everyone.\n\nThat plan—headed for a Budget Committee vote Thursday—calls for a minimum of $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over a decade and a maximum of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts from the Ways and Means Committee. It would also increase the federal debt limit by $4 trillion, likely enough to get through about two years. The plan also calls for $300 billion in new spending, likely for immigration enforcement and defense.\n\nThe release of the plan came as Senate Republicans also claimed progress Wednesday in implementing President Trump’s top priorities. But the House and Senate are still moving in different and incompatible directions, and they have to resolve that dispute before they can get anything significant to Trump’s desk.\n\nThe House plan says it is ultimately aiming for $2 trillion in spending-cut reductions and that the goal would be to reduce the Ways and Means deficit-increasing allowance if spending cuts don’t hit that target.\n\nThose targets are going to test House Republicans’ ability to unify their fractious, narrow majority, now at 218-215. Writing subsequent legislation that stays within those thresholds could prove challenging.\n\n“We’ve got to be working with our members, whipping the bill, doing other things, to get it passed on the floor,” said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R., La.) “That’s never been an easy process in the past. This will be no different this year.”\n\nThe spending-cut minimum is below the $2 trillion or $2.5 trillion floor that the most conservative House Republicans wanted to hit. The tax cut maximum is below the $5.5 trillion that would allow for extending all of the tax cuts that expire at the end of this year and make room for Trump priorities such as tax-free tips, overtime pay and Social Security benefits.\n\nRep. Jason Smith (R., Mo.), the Ways and Means chairman, has said that $4.5 trillion wouldn’t be enough to accomplish all of Trump’s tax priorities.\n\nRepublicans are planning to assume that real economic growth—caused by their plans and Trump’s actions on deregulation and fossil-fuel production—can be higher than the 1.8% forecast by the Congressional Budget Office. That would throw off enough tax revenue so Republicans can claim that their plan wouldn’t add to budget deficits.\n\nBut such growth is difficult to achieve and sustain, economists say, especially because Trump’s immigration and tariff policies tend to slow growth.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Senate, the Budget Committee began advancing the first phase of its two-track plan.\n\nInstead of one big bill, Republican senators wrote a budget aimed at allowing a roughly $350 billion package focused on border-security and national defense. They want to save the messier tax and spending debate until later in the year.\n\nTom Homan, Trump’s border czar, and budget chief Russell Vought met with Senate Republicans on Tuesday and emphasized how they’re running out of money for the immigration enforcement Trump wants, said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), the Budget Committee chairman. The idea is to provide enough money now to cover Trump’s immigration priorities for the next four years, offset with spending cuts and revenue from energy leases over four years.\n\n“Why would they come over and tell us, begging for money, if they didn’t want to move?” Graham said. “I think they came over to create a sense of urgency, that we need the money and we need it now for border and the military.”\n\nGraham and Republican senators say they understand the House’s approach—the theory being that the House can only corral its members once in a single pass-fail exercise—but they just don’t think it’s doable now. The Senate budget doesn’t make room for tax-cut extensions nor does it require spending cuts as large as the House plan.\n\n“This isn’t easy,” said Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.). “I think we’re all finding one big beautiful bill is also one really big, complex and hard to even draft—much less pass—bill as well.”\n\nRepublicans are using the process known as budget reconciliation to advance Trump’s priorities. That approach lets them push a bill through the Senate with a simple majority, avoiding the 60-vote filibuster threshold and the need for Democratic votes. \n\nBut reconciliation is clunky. It can only be used for fiscal matters such as taxes and spending, not major policy changes on issues such as immigration. \n\nAnd Republicans can use it only if the House and Senate first agree on a budget.'], [""It's time\n\n![gif](giphy|h5NLPVn3rg0Rq)"", 'Oh shit, they are here.

U.S. President Donald Trump has ruled out both sending U.S. forces and allowing Ukraine to join NATO, meaning that any effort to prevent Russia from attacking Ukraine again would have to be borne by Europeans.\n\nThe U.S. sent a questionnaire to European NATO countries asking them to spell out what they would be prepared to offer to enforce a peace agreement, as well as what they would expect from the U.S.\n\nBut there was no consensus on the issue.\n\nFrance, whose President Emmanuel Macron first suggested the idea, and the U.K.\'s Keir Starmer both support the idea, although Starmer said that could only happen if the United States also participated in any peacekeeping force.\n\nHe insisted on the need for a “U.S. backstop” after peace is secured in Ukraine, in order to “deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again.”\n\nBut Poland, a frontline state and close ally of Ukraine, with one of the largest militaries in Europe, demurred.\n\n""We do not anticipate sending Polish soldiers to Ukraine,"" Tusk said in Warsaw before flying to Paris.\n\n“Poland simply doesn’t have the additional capacity to send troops to Ukraine,” said a senior Polish official who spoke on condition of anonymity, noting the country has long borders with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and Russia-allied Belarus, which need to be reinforced with Polish forces. “The French are far away so they can send soldiers to Ukraine; we’re close so we cannot.”\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said after the meeting that any debate on sending peacekeepers to Ukraine was ""completely premature"" and ""highly inappropriate"" while the war continued.\n\nDenmark’s Mette Frederiksen said ""many, many"" things needed to be clarified before troops can be sent to Ukraine.', ""The reality of the European Union rears its ugly head.\n\nIt's one thing for people to be vocal online about a European Army, etc. - but the chain reaction that is required to get us there practically is complex, long and fraught with challenges."", '>He insisted on the need for a “U.S. backstop” after peace is secured in Ukraine, in order to “deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again.”\n\nObviously, the idea is to make Europe the backstop to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again.

Google now hopes to move beyond SMS, which has become so frequently abused that it negates any supposed security benefit. Instead of using SMS, the company will reportedly switch to using QR codes.\n\n>Currently, Google sends SMS codes for two reasons: to confirm that a new login is legitimate and to block spammers from opening Gmail accounts in bulk. You type in your credentials, and a moment later, Google texts a six-digit code for you to enter as well. It\'s not a terribly arduous process, and it can help protect your account, but SMS is not very secure.\n\n>SMS messages are delivered by mobile carriers without encryption, and they often go through intermediaries that can be compromised without your knowledge. Even if the line is secure, phone numbers have very little in the way of security.\n\n>SIM swap attacks are depressingly common today, with carrier reps tricked or paid off to transfer a phone number to a fraudster\'s device. At that point, the two-factor codes from Google go right to the attacker, allowing them to log in. This same attack has been used to access crypto wallets and make off with valuable digital currency. Gaining control of the target\'s email is often a necessary step to unlock other accounts.\n\n>According to Forbes, Google plans to patch this vulnerability soon. The company will stop using SMS codes for verification, moving to a QR code that the user has to scan with their phone. \n\n>""Just like we want to move past passwords with the use of things like passkeys, we want to move away from sending SMS messages for authentication,"" Google spokesperson Ross Richendrfer told Forbes.\n\n>Moving to QR codes takes SMS out of the equation, which also means you don\'t have to worry about your carrier\'s security practices or lack thereof. Google also points out that QR code scanning makes phishing scams harder. It\'s relatively easy to trick someone into providing an SMS code. Scammers often do this by pretending to be associated with Google, but you can\'t share what you don\'t have.\n\n>Google has not offered much in the way of specifics here. Richendrfer says the change will roll out in ""the next few months,"" but it\'s unclear if all markets will see this change simultaneously. If you already use two-factor on your account, for example with a code generator app or a security key, you\'ll continue using that to verify your account.
